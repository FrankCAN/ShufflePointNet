# Overview
We propose a deep-wide neural network, called ShufflePointNet, to exploit fine-grained local features and reduce redundancy in parallel using group convolution and channel shuffle operation. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both shape classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

In this repository, we release code for training a ShufflePointNet classification network on ModelNet40 dataset and segmentation network on ShapeNet part, S3DIS, KITTI dataset.
